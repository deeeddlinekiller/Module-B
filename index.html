                 <p>I think I remember it perhaps from when I was youngers and back in the 90s and stuff like that. 
                    I kind of feel cheated, or sort of a bit like they play on this. They play on my anxiety or my fear. 
                    I'd like describe it a thorn. I think a thought in that sense of something that's sort of trickling like that, Sort of annoys you for a moment. And then you whisk it away.
                    The sound will be like cheering football crowd, like a lot of people. stadium of people sorts of singing.

                 <p>Always when I want to watch an important football match, have to go to these legal sites, then it pops up with all these ads and I cannot close them
                    Sometimes there are just too many ads for me to get through. So I spent 10 minutes just closing down ads before I actually get to the match. 
                    It's a bit like a tomato. You want to take it in your hand, and then squeeze it, or jump on it, and then provide at the wall or something like that, because it makes me so angry and frustrated.

                <p>I have a guitar APP where you can see chords for different songs. 
                    then it shows every time you press onto a song, I guess that's how they make their money on nonsubscribers. 
                    I think it's mostly annoyance, annoying. it's just waste time 
                    It's like rain, it's mostly annoying, but it's also like premise for being outside. it's very necessary. 
                    It's like a very high-pitched speaker saying.
